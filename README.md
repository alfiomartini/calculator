# An Arithmetic Calculating Machine

This is an implementation of a basic arithmetic calculator using HTML/CSS/Javascript. The machine accepts _arbitrary arithmetic floating point expressions_ using the operations of sum, division, multiplication and subtraction. Brackets to group subexpressions are currently not supported, so the expressions are parsed from left to right using _regular expressions_. Tests are written with the _Jest/Puppeteer_ framework.
